# Tic Tac Toe
## First Ever Web Development Project! 

As a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive class (Summer 2018) our first project is to build a Tic Tac Toe game. As a newcomer to coding this is quite a challenge!

Concisely put, the goal of the project is to create a web application which allows a user to play Tic Tac Toe. Sound easy? Think again!

The Tic Tac Toe application must:

- be built from scratch, without a starter codebase
- be a single page web application with no browser refresh
- map out the logic of the game
- allow the user to create a login / password protected account and view their game statistics
- separate not only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files but also ideally abide by a modular file structure which stores Client, DOM manipulation, and network code, in different files. 
- document your approach to the project in a ‘readme.md’ file (This!)
- utilize a GitHub repository for version control and be deployed as a GitHub page on my GitHub account
- use JQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
- use AJAX for interacting with a provided API to store the ‘state of the game’

As of the start of the project I have been learning (‘all of the above’) for a grand total of 2 weeks and 2 days and we had one week to complete it. Talk about trial by fire!

Technologies used:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
JQuery
AJAX
terminal console
GIT repository

“where do I begin??”

As an artist and visual learner I like to SEE what I am trying to do.  I created this wireframe / user flow chart to clarify the game.

These are my User Flows (I’d love to return to these and elaborate with more detail):

Coming up with the game logic in JavaScript was the hardest part for me.  The types of JS commands and logic I have learned in the past 2-3 weeks are so new to me that accessing them in my mind as tools was a challenge.

click handlers, API-token-auth, getFormFields, console.log, modals, curl request…I did not know any such terms existed until I started this course.

I have been tracking my progress (or lack thereof ;-\) in GitHub's project manager:

Stylistically I envision the game as giving a nod to pastel neon and including a good number of animations.

I like the colors / feeling of this image:

It would be nice if
It were DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
